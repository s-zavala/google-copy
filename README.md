Replica of the appearance of Google's main page.

The semantic content of the Google page is minimal. There are five groups of links distributed between the header and footer. The primary focus of the page is the content in the main element. This is the image of the Google logo and a form of text input and two submit buttons.

The styling is elegant, minimal, with small flourishes that are both Google-isms and nameless. The horizontal navigation bars in header and footer are separated into user friendly groupings of one to four elements. The main form is centered horizontally and in the top half of the page vertically.

The challenge of this replica was laying out the link groups. The header, main, and footer are stacked using CSS grid property grid-template rows. The navigation bars layout uses CSS flexbox property flex-wrap for the parent container and the shorthand property flex for child boxes. My goal was to practice using grid and flexbox to make a responsive page.
